## How to Run the Project

1.  git clone this repo
    
2. Ensure Docker is installed on your system. [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/]
    
3. Configure the backend .env file with your TMDB API key and TMDB read access token. [Please take a look on example.env and make a copy with the name .env] [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api]
    
4. In your termnial, run inside the root directory ```docker-compose up --build```

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT
    
*   **Deployment:** Docker
    

**Backend**

The backend server automatically fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDb) and stores it in our database. This data is refetched every week to provide new movie suggestions. This approach reduces the API keyâ€™s rate limits, ensures consistent data delivery to the frontend, allows for faster loading of the landing page by controlling the fetched data, and prevents any impact from backend changes, such as removing The Movie Database or adding new sources. Additionally, the backend logic is isolated from the database, enabling easy manipulation of data and future deployment as independent services.

**Future Improvements**

*   List user's watch list.
    
*   Mark movies as watched.
    
*   Show what to watch next.
    
*   Enable users to share their watch lists.
